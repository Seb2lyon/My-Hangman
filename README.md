# My Hangman
Little PHP code for a Hangman game online (in French).
There's 3 levels of difficulties and it's using a very huge list of words (368439 words of 4 letters or more), based on the Scrabble's Official dictionary 2003 (ODS4).
The words are all in French (singular or plurial names, infinitive or conjugated verbs...).

It works with a database that manage the list of words (database configuration file is included... just import it to your own database).

This is an old projet that I've updated recently. I hope you will enjoy it :D

Don't hesitate to submit me some improvements (there must be a lot)... ;)
